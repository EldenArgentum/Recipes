  <h1>Alfredo... My Way</h1>
  This recipe blends together elements from both authentic alfredo recipes and not-so-authentic recipes,
  which results in a simple but elegantly tasty dish.
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <body>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Heavy Whipped Cream </strong><em>400ml</em></li>
        <li><strong>Butter</strong> <em>7tbsp</em></li>
        <li><strong>Parmigiano Reggiano (GRATE YOURSELF!!!)</strong> <em>1/2 block</em> <em> <strong>NOTE:</strong> You should grate cheese yourself, if you can, because pre-grated cheeses contain cellulose and anti-caking agents, making cheese more difficult to melt, and can cause splitting sauce.</em></li>
    </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Grate your cheese beforehand, right before you start the rest of the recipe, for best freshness & results.</li>
    <li>Start with boiling the pasta, following the instructions found on the packaging.</li>
  </ol>
